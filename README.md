# HCR-signal-localisation
Cell segregation (Cellpose) from the 3D image of the zebrafish habenula. Localise the RNA signals (skimage.feature.blob_log) in the cells and identify co-localisation of two different RNA signals (tac3a and vglut1). Merge the segregation &amp; RNA blob data and produce visualised result (napari view &amp; 3D animation) to illustrate the localisation of RNA
